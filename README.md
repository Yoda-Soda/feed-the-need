## Brief

In this course you have designed, built, secured and deployed a full stack application from scratch

## Rationale

This course will as much as possible simulate a real world software delivery environment.  As well as cutting code, You will need to learn about the other parts of software engineering such as requirements analysis, database design, security, deployment, and agile process.

## Instructions 
During the course, build your app into this empty repository.  You may create as many branches and pull requests as you see fit.
You will be continually be mentored through the entire process in your daily communications with your team and instructor.  Good luck!
